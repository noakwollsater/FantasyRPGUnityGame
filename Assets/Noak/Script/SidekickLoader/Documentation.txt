1. Get new FBX files from Sidekick

2. Assign materials to all new parts – Use MultiFolderMaterialAssigner to apply the correct materials to all imported models.

3. Organize parts into the correct folders – Use OrganizeMeshes to extract skinned mesh parts from the FBX files and save them as prefabs in the correct Parts category.

4. If new parts have appeared – Use PartVariantsUpdater to update existing PartVariants without creating new ones.

5. If a new category/part is needed – Use FullAutoPartVariantsCreator to create new PartVariants for new parts (with support for single or dual path).
